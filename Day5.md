# Loops

Loops in Python are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true or for a fixed number of iterations. Python supports two main types of loops: for loop and while loop.

1. for Loop

The for loop iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, string, or range) and executes a block of code for each element in the sequence.

Syntax:

    for item in sequence:
    # Code to execute

2. while Loop

The while loop continues to execute the code block as long as the condition is true.

Syntax:
        
    while condition:
    # Code to execute
