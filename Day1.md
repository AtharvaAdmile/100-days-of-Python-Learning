Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
Naming Rules:

Must begin with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
Can contain letters, numbers (0-9), and underscores but cannot start with a number.
Cannot use reserved keywords (e.g., if, for, while).

1. Case-Sensitivity:

Variable names are case-sensitive.

2. Dynamic Typing:

The type of a variable is inferred from the value assigned to it.
You can reassign a variable to a value of a different type.

3. Scope of Variables:

Variables can have different scopes depending on where they are declared:
Global: Declared outside any function or block and accessible anywhere in the code.
Local: Declared within a function and accessible only inside that function.
